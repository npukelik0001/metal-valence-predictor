# Metal Song Emotional Valence Predictor ðŸŽ¸

This project applies regression modeling to predict the emotional positivity (valence) of metal songs based on their audio features. It was developed for CIS 9660 - Data Mining for Business Analytics and deployed using Streamlit.

---

## Overview

The goal of this project is to help independent artists and music teams in the metal scene identify which songs are more emotionally positive and potentially more appealing for promotion. The target variable is **valence**, a score from 0 (sad) to 1 (happy), pulled from Spotify's audio analysis API.

## Dataset

- **Source**: [Spotify Tracks Dataset by Maharshi Pandya (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maharshipandya/-spotify-tracks-dataset/data)
- **Filtered Size**: ~4,000 songs from metal subgenres
- **Genres used**: black-metal, death-metal, heavy-metal, metalcore, metal
- **Key Features**: danceability, energy, loudness, speechiness, duration, tempo, key, and more

---

## Data Preprocessing

- Dropped missing/duplicate rows
- Filtered for metal-related subgenres
- One-hot encoded tempo categories, subgenres, and keys
- Scaled numerical features using StandardScaler

---

## Model Development

Trained and compared the following regression models:

- Linear Regression  
- Ridge Regression  
- Lasso Regression  
- Random Forest  
- Gradient Boosting  
- **XGBoost** âœ… (Best performer)

**Metrics used**: RÂ², RMSE, MAE  
**Final model**: XGBoost â€” saved as `xgb_model.pkl`  
**Scaler**: StandardScaler â€” saved as `scaler.pkl`

## Disclaimer

This model explains about **51% of the variation in valence**, which is reasonable given that musical emotion is influenced by many subjective and unmeasurable factors. This was built for educational use only.
